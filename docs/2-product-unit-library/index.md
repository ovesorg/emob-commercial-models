## Product-Unit Library

### Overview

This is a **living catalog** of all Product-Units available in the OVES commercial model.

Each Product-Unit is defined across the five dimensions:

1. Identity (what it is)
2. Value (why it exists commercially)
3. Context (dependencies)
4. Obligations (what we must deliver)
5. Costs (financial implications)

### Library Organization

Product-Units are organized by category:

* **Physical** — Tangible assets (batteries, vehicles, chargers, accessories)
* **Service** — Recurring or one-time services (subscriptions, maintenance, support)
* **Digital & Operational** — App features, IoT capabilities, platform access
* **Regulatory** — Compliance, registration, legal documentation
* **Composite** — Multi-component units combining elements from multiple categories

### Three Core Product-Unit Types (Proposed)

1. **Physical Product**  
   Examples: LEV E3-Pro, S3, chargers, accessories

2. **Service Product**  
   Example: Swap Subscription or other recurring service

3. **Deposit-Based Entitlement** *(critical new category)*  
   A deposit product that grants the customer long-term access to a **pool of assets**, without tying them to a specific serial-numbered item.

### The Missing Building Block: Deposit-Based Entitlement

When a battery is issued to a customer, it is a high-value asset that must be financially safeguarded.

But the customer is:
- **Not buying** a battery
- **Not renting a specific one** either

The cleanest commercial interpretation: **they place a deposit** to access the service and its assets.

**Key Question**: How do we structure and present this deposit value, especially at end-of-service?

Possible approaches:
- **Refund** the deposit to the customer
- **Convert** the deposit into value toward a physical item (e.g., discounted used battery)
- **Liquidate** the deposit under clearly defined rules (e.g., if obligations are unmet)
