## Product-Unit Library

### Overview

This is a **living catalog** of all Product-Units available in the OVES commercial model.

Each Product-Unit is defined across the five dimensions:

1. Identity (what it is)
2. Value (why it exists commercially)
3. Context (dependencies)
4. Obligations (what we must deliver)
5. Costs (financial implications)

### Library Organization

Product-Units are organized by category (from the four-category taxonomy):

- **Physical Product-Units** — Tangible assets (batteries, vehicles, chargers, accessories)
- **Digital Product-Units** — App features, IoT capabilities, platform access
- **Service Product-Units** — Recurring or one-time services (subscription services, maintenance, support)
- **Contract Product-Units** — Entitlements and obligations (deposits, long-duration contracts, memberships)

### Three Core Product-Unit Types (Proposed)

1. **Physical Product-Unit**  
   Examples: LEV E3-Pro, S3, chargers, accessories

2. **Service Product-Unit**  
   Example: Swap subscription service or other recurring service

3. **Contract Product-Unit (Deposit-Based Entitlement)** *(critical building block)*  
   A deposit-backed or contract-backed Product-Unit that grants the customer long-term access to a **pool of assets**, without tying them to a specific serial-numbered item.

### The Missing Building Block: Deposit-Based Entitlement

When a battery is issued to a customer, it is a high-value asset that must be financially safeguarded.

But the customer is:
- **Not buying** a battery
- **Not renting a specific one** either

The cleanest commercial interpretation: **they place a deposit** to access the service and its assets.

**Key Question**: How do we structure and present this deposit value, especially at end-of-service?

Possible approaches:
- **Refund** the deposit to the customer
- **Convert** the deposit into value toward a physical item (e.g., discounted used battery)
- **Liquidate** the deposit under clearly defined rules (e.g., if obligations are unmet)
