# Digital Product-Units

## Overview

Digital Product-Units represent media-type products such as apps, dashboards, and platform services.

**Current Status:** Reserved for future use; kept here to support future digital product lines.

### Potential Product Types

- App features (customer and agent apps)
- IoT dashboards (fleet, battery, charger telemetry)
- Platform services (CARM access, integration APIs)

## Characteristics of Digital Product-Units

**Common Attributes:**

- **Access-Based** — Typically licensed or subscription-based access rather than one-time purchase
- **Scalable** — Low marginal cost to serve additional users
- **Platform-Dependent** — Requires underlying technical infrastructure (cloud hosting, APIs, mobile OS)
- **Updateable** — Can be enhanced, patched, or updated without physical distribution

**Obligations:**

- **Availability Guarantees** — Uptime SLAs for cloud-based services
- **Data Privacy & Security** — Compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, local laws)
- **User Support** — Technical assistance, onboarding, training materials
- **Version Compatibility** — Backward compatibility or migration support for updates

## Future Considerations

Digital Product-Units will be activated when concrete offerings are defined (e.g., premium app features, digital content, or licensing models).
