Here is a concise summary of a four-category Product-Unit taxonomy, and why it is consistent with and conducive to contemporary digital / blockchain-era commerce.

## Product-Unit Taxonomy: Four Commercial Categories

A modern framework aligned with global digital commerce and asset-based services.

Your Product-Unit universe can be fully expressed using four commercial categories.
Every Product-Unit belongs to one or more of these categories.
Every offering—physical, digital, service, entitlement, subscription, deposit, bundle—is a composition of Product-Units that each sit in one or more of these categories.

---

### 1. Physical Product-Unit — The Tangible Asset Layer

### **Definition**

A real, manufactured object that must be stocked, delivered, serviced, and tracked.

### **Examples**

Batteries, chargers, vehicles, hardware modules, mounting kits.

### **Why It Matters**

Physical goods are increasingly accompanied by digital identity and service layers (digital twins, telemetry, remote activation).
This matches global EV and IoT practices where the physical product is only **one part** of the customer value.

---

### 2. Digital Product-Unit — The Access & Data Layer

### **Definition**

Non-physical deliverables that provide access, rights, telemetry, firmware, analytics, or digital capabilities.

### **Examples**

App onboarding, CARM dashboards, firmware upgrades, data packages.

### **Why It Matters**

Digital products now **shape the customer experience**, enhance asset value, and enable service differentiation.
This aligns with the global trend toward:

* software-defined hardware
* digital feature unlocks
* cloud-linked vehicle / asset identity systems
* tokenized access in decentralized ecosystems

Digital products make mobility and energy systems **programmable**.

---

### 3. Service Product-Unit — The Operational Value Layer

### **Definition**

An action, process, or ongoing operational effort delivered by OVES: one-time or recurring.

### **Examples**

Swap services, maintenance, installation, delivery, diagnostics, extended warranty.

### **Why It Matters**

The world has shifted toward **service-based commerce** (“X-as-a-Service”):
Mobility, energy, software, and infrastructure are increasingly delivered as **continuous value**, not one-time purchases.

Your swap model fits perfectly into this global paradigm:

* recurring relationships
* predictable revenue
* measurable usage
* differentiable tiers

### 4. Contract Product-Unit — The Entitlement & Obligation Layer

*(The most modern and strategically powerful category.)*

### **Definition**

A Product-Unit whose sale creates a commercial state, defining rights, obligations, privileges, or conditional future deliverables.

Contract Product-Units typically:

Deposit Product-Units, swap eligibility Product-Units, rental rights Product-Units, access tier Product-Units, fleet operator rights Product-Units.

### **Why It Matters**

In modern commerce, the contract can be treated as a Product-Unit in its own right.

This category parallels:

* tokenized ownership (without blockchain hype)
* programmable entitlements
* financialized access rights
* asset-backed service agreements
* membership or privilege ecosystems

Contract Product-Units enable:

* refundable deposits
* conditional access
* tiered entitlements
* obligations tied to future behavior

This category prepares OVES for the **post-ownership economy**, where rights and obligations matter more than the asset itself.

---

## Core Insight

Physical, Digital, Service, and Contract are classification categories for Product-Units.

Every Product-Unit OVES defines is assigned to one or more of these four categories.
Every commercial offering is a composition of Product-Units, each with:

- A clear metric (piece, time, count, etc.) as defined in `1-concepts.md`
- A category (or categories) from this taxonomy

Bundles are defined in ABS as compositions of Product-Units (using these categories).
Odoo records only the Product-Units as line items; it does not mirror bundles.

## Mapping Traditional Product Concepts → Product-Unit Categories

| Traditional Concept         | Old Interpretation    | Modern Interpretation (Your Framework)             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical Goods**          | Hardware item         | **Physical Product**                               |
| **Software License**        | File or code          | **Digital Product** (access right, feature flag)   |
| **Warranty / Installation** | Add-on services       | **Service Product**                                |
| **Deposit**                 | Financial placeholder | **Contract Product** (obligation + entitlement)    |
| **Subscription**            | Recurring billing     | **Service Product** + **Contract Product** (rules) |
| **Entitlement**             | “Privilege”           | **Contract Product** controlling service access    |
| **Bundle**                  | SKU combination       | **Composition** of the 4 types (ABS logic)         |
| **Membership**              | Customer tier         | **Contract Product** + optional Digital Product    |
| **Swap Program**            | Service plan          | **Service Product** + **Contract Product**         |

## Mapping to Emerging Global Trends

| Emerging Trend                | Your Category Fit             | Why It Aligns                          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Software-defined hardware** | Physical + Digital            | Hardware identity + feature unlocks    |
| **Subscription mobility**     | Service + Contract            | Recurring value + entitlement rights   |
| **Tokenized entitlements**    | Contract + Digital            | Programmable rights, future-proof      |
| **Usage-based billing**       | Service                       | Swap, charging, IoT events             |
| **Deposit-backed services**   | Contract                      | Financialized access rights            |
| **Dynamic bundling**          | Compositions via ABS          | No SKU explosion, rule-driven          |
| **IoT asset ecosystems**      | Physical + Digital + Contract | Identity → entitlement → service model |

This places OVES at the **front edge** of global commerce evolution.

## Summary

OVES defines all products as compositions of Product-Units.
Each Product-Unit:

- Has a clear metric and five-dimensional definition (see `1-concepts.md`)
- Is classified into one or more of four commercial categories: Physical, Digital, Service, Contract

These two layers—Product-Unit structure and Product-Unit taxonomy—together align OVES with modern digital commerce and asset-based mobility.
