## Structure

### Product-Unit Dimensions

Every Product-Unit must be defined across five dimensions:

#### 1. Product-Unit (Identity)

A discrete commercial object that can be referenced in pricing, contracts, channel activities, and customer interactions.

**Characteristics:**

* Clearly identified and uniquely named
* Can appear alone or as part of a bundle
* Must be traceable through the operational workflow

#### 2. Product-Unit Value

Defines *why this unit exists commercially*.

**Includes:**

* Customer-perceived value
* Business commitments
* Risk exposure
* Expected lifecycle contribution (revenue / cost / retention)

#### 3. Product-Unit Context

Defines the **dependencies** required for a Product-Unit to function.

**Examples:**

* A swap credit only has meaning if a valid battery subscription exists
* An installation service requires a physical device as context
* A subscription requires an app onboarding context

#### 4. Product-Unit Obligations

Defines operational duties the company must fulfill when the Product-Unit is sold.

**Examples:**

* Warranty terms
* Service response time
* Charger maintenance
* App support
* Battery replacement guarantees

#### 5. Product-Unit Costs

Defines all costs directly mapped to obligations and value delivery.

**Categories:**

* Capital cost
* Operating cost
* Logistics & deployment
* Customer support
* Depreciation & lifecycle management
