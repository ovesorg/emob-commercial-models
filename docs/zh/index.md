# eMob Commercial Models

## Purpose

Framework for creating commercial offerings using a "Product-Unit" approach. Define individual product units with intrinsic value propositions, then compose them into customer-meaningful bundles.

**Product Category & Naming:** Consistent with mainstream where appropriate. Compelling narratives where innovative.

**Implementation:** Odoo product management architecture (categories, packages, BoM).

## Approach

- **Short-term**: Define Product-Units and bundles for immediate market needs
- **Long-term**: Refine methodology based on customer feedback and market data
