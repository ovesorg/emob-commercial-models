## Types

### Bundle Classification

Bundles are classified by their primary design intent:

#### 1. Logical Grouping Bundles

Product-Units that naturally belong together for functional or operational reasons.

**Examples:**
- Battery + Charger + Installation
- Motorcycle + Registration Service
- Vehicle + Basic Accessories Kit

**Characteristics:**
- Components have strong interdependencies
- Rarely sold separately in practice
- Simplifies inventory and fulfillment

#### 2. Value Proposition Bundles

Created to address specific customer use cases or economic incentives.

**Examples:**
- Starter Kit Bundle (complete new customer setup)
- Delivery Driver Pack (commercial use optimization)
- Multi-Battery Efficiency Bundle (high-usage customer)

**Characteristics:**
- Tailored to customer segment needs
- Provides economic discount vs. individual purchase
- Addresses complete workflow or use case

#### 3. Channel-Specific Bundles

Optimized for specific sales channels or distribution models.

**Examples:**
- Agent Sales Starter Package
- Franchise Standard Inventory Bundle
- Self-Service App-Only Bundle

**Characteristics:**
- Matches channel capabilities and constraints
- Simplified for channel training
- Pre-configured for channel pricing rules

#### 4. Mission/Use-Case Bundles

Designed around specific customer missions or operational scenarios.

**Examples:**
- Last-Mile Delivery Bundle
- Ride-Hailing Professional Bundle
- Rural Area Extended Range Bundle

**Characteristics:**
- Addresses complete operational need
- May include specialized configurations
- Higher value, longer decision cycle

### Bundle Hierarchy

Bundles can contain:
- **Base Product-Units** (atomic elements)
- **Other Bundles** (nested bundles for complex offerings)

**Caution**: Avoid excessive nesting (max 2 levels) to prevent:
- Obligation tracking complexity
- System performance issues
- Agent confusion
- Customer misunderstanding
