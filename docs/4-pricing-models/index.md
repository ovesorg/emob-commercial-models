# Pricing Models

## Overview

Pricing is an **Odoo-domain responsibility**. Odoo is the system of record for:

- **Retail prices** and costing for all Product-Units (Physical, Service, Contract, Digital, Composite).
- **Channel pricing rules** (by agent, outlet, partner, or market).
- **Promotions and discounts** applied at product or bundle level.

This chapter is a **work-in-progress starting point** and provides a basic structure for commercial teams to expand. It does **not** attempt to fully define pricing strategy; instead, it sets out the key areas to document.

We focus on **retail pricing and costing** at a conceptual level only, since these are standard Odoo capabilities.

## Structure

- **Pricing Types**  How different pricing dimensions (retail, subscription, usage-based) are expressed in Odoo.
- **Channel Pricing**  Options for agent/partner pricing, including trade margin, commission, and revenue share strategies.
- **Price Governance**  Controls for pricing integrity, approvals, and propagation consistency (including ABS service unit prices).
