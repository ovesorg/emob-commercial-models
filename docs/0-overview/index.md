## Overview

### Purpose of the Commercial Model Project

Define a **commercially coherent, operationally actionable** framework that describes all **Product-Units**, how they create value, how they combine into offerings, and how they are transacted and operated in the field.

This framework must lead to **ready-to-use Commercial Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs)** aligned with OVES's sales channels, app workflows, and customer-facing interactions.

### Relationship to BUFM

This project mirrors the **unit-composition approach** previously used in the **BUFM** project, but focuses on **commercial logic, product definition, bundling, pricing, transactions, and operational SoPs**.

### How to Use This Documentation

Use this documentation as a basis for:

* Detailed analysis and model design
* Documentation generation
* SoP creation
* Product-Unit definitions for specific use cases
* Bundle design and pricing logic

### Two-Horizon Alignment

**Short Term (30 days)**: Tools and workflows allowing immediate sales execution.

**Long Term (12–24 months)**: Architecture supporting the full commercial model vision.

### Core Architecture Consensus

"Odoo handles commercial workflow. ABS handles smart assets. They handshake to deliver customer satisfaction."
