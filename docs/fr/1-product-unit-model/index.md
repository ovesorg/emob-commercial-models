## Product-Unit Model

### Introduction

The project adopts a **unit-composition** methodology, similar to BUFM.

Each "Product-Unit" is a **minimal, identifiable commercial element**—either:

* A **physical product** (e.g., battery, charger, vehicle)
* A **service-based product** (e.g., subscription, swap credit, warranty extension)
* A **deposit-based entitlement** (e.g., asset pool access)

Each Product-Unit must be fully defined across **five dimensions**:

1. **Product-Unit** — the discrete commercial object itself
2. **Product-Unit Value** — why this unit exists commercially
3. **Product-Unit Context** — dependencies required for function
4. **Product-Unit Obligations** — operational duties when sold
5. **Product-Unit Costs** — all costs mapped to obligations and value delivery

### Why Unit-Composition?

* Clarity in pricing, contracts, channel activities, and customer interactions
* Traceability through operational workflows
* Modular bundling and flexible offerings
* Alignment with Odoo, OVApp, and IoT systems
