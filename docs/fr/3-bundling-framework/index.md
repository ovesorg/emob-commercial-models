## Bundling Framework

### Why Bundling Matters

Bundles combine multiple Product-Units into coherent offerings that:

**For Customers:**
- Simplify purchase decisions
- Provide economic value vs. individual components
- Address complete use cases
- Reduce transaction friction

**For Business:**
- Increase average transaction value
- Reduce sales cycle complexity
- Improve product attachment rates
- Enable market segmentation

**For Channels:**
- Simplify sales narratives
- Reduce agent training requirements
- Enable standardized quotations
- Improve sales velocity

### Bundling Principles

1. **Value Clarity**: Bundle must provide clear economic or functional advantage
2. **Operational Feasibility**: Can be fulfilled without excessive complexity
3. **System Compatibility**: Works within Odoo/OVApp constraints
4. **Customer Understanding**: Easy to explain and understand
5. **Channel Alignment**: Suitable for target sales channels
