## 9.1 Glossary

| Term | System / Domain | Definition |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Odoo | Commercial (CRM / ERP) | System of record for commercial transactions: customers, products, pricing, sales orders, payments, invoices, and subscriptions (see [5.6 Odoo Models](../5-transactional-models/6-odoo-models.md)). |
| ABS (Asset Backoffice System) | Asset / Entitlement | System of record for assets, entitlements, BSS services, bundles, plans, and usage events. Handles smart asset operations and pool management (see [5.7 ABS Models](../5-transactional-models/7-abs-models.md)). |
| DIRAC | Analytics / Orchestration | Emerging platform for advanced analytics, ML, and cross-system orchestration across Odoo and ABS (see [1.6 Dirac-Odoo-ABS](../1-product-unit-model/6-dirac-odoo-abs.md)). |
| OVApp | Client / Frontend | Customer and agent application that drives sales and service flows by calling Odoo and ABS APIs. Never a system of record (see [5.8 OVApp Workflows](../5-transactional-models/8-ovapp-workflows.md)). |
| CRM (Customer Relationship Management) | Commercial Model | Discipline and tooling for managing customer data, interactions, and sales pipelines; in this project, primarily implemented in Odoo. |
| ARM (Asset Relationship Management) | Asset Model | Discipline and tooling for managing smart assets, their lifecycle, and customer entitlements; in this project, primarily implemented in ABS. |
| Product-Unit (PU) | Commercial Model | Atomic quid pro quo unit ("this for that") with a defined metric and unit (e.g. piece, day, count, kWh). Recorded as line items in Odoo (see [1.1–1.2 Product-Unit Model](../1-product-unit-model/index.md) and [2-Product-Unit Library](../2-product-unit-library/index.md)). |
| Physical Product-Unit | Odoo / ABS | PU representing a tangible asset (e.g. motorbike model). Odoo tracks inventory; ABS tracks concrete asset items and lifecycle. |
| Service Product-Unit | Odoo / ABS | PU representing access or usage of a service (e.g. Battery Circulation, Swap Network, Swap Count, Electricity). Mapped to ABS `service` objects (see [2.2 Service Product-Units](../2-product-unit-library/2-service.md)). |
| Contract Product-Unit | Odoo / ABS | PU representing a contractual entitlement (e.g. Swap Privilege, Warranty, Rental, Lease, Asset-Assignment contract). Coupled to ABS `plan` and entitlement logic (see [2.4 Contract Product-Units](../2-product-unit-library/4-contract.md)). |
| Digital Product-Unit | Odoo / ABS (future) | PU category reserved for future digital/media offerings delivered over the network. |
| Composite Product-Unit | Odoo | PU in Odoo that combines other PUs using a BoM/pack mechanism (e.g. vehicle + service contracts). ABS only sees the decomposed child PUs (see [1.4 Odoo System](../1-product-unit-model/4-odoo-system.md)). |
| Bundle (ABS Bundle) | ABS | ABS-domain construct grouping interdependent BSS services into a coherent offer (e.g. swap access + battery circulation). Bundles are never mirrored as products in Odoo (see [3.3 BSS Bundles](../3-product-bundle-library/3-bss-bundles.md) and [8.2 BSS Setup Data Types](../8-integration-devops/2-bss-setup-data-types.md)). |
| Setup Data (BSS Setup Data) | ABS | Configuration data in ABS defining BSS services, bundles, terms, and plans that operationalize the commercial model (see [8.2 BSS Setup Data Types](../8-integration-devops/2-bss-setup-data-types.md)). |
| BSS (Battery Swap Service) | ABS / Business Model | Foundational business model for battery swapping, built from ABS services and bundles (network access, swap count, energy, asset-assignment, etc.) (see [3-Product-Bundle Library](../3-product-bundle-library/index.md)). |
| BSS Service (`service`) | ABS | ABS setup object defining a single service dimension (e.g. network access, swap count, electricity, asset-assignment) with metric, unit, and asset reference (see [8.2 BSS Setup Data Types](../8-integration-devops/2-bss-setup-data-types.md)). |
| Terms (`terms`) | ABS | ABS setup object defining duration, period, and commercial conditions applied to a plan (e.g. 30 days, 12 months). |
| Service Plan Template (`plan`) | ABS / Odoo | ABS `plan` + `terms` definition for a generic offer (no customer). Exposed in Odoo as a Subscription/Contract PU that stores the ABS `plan.id` (see [8.2 BSS Setup Data Types](../8-integration-devops/2-bss-setup-data-types.md)). |
| Service Plan Instance (`plan_instance`) | ABS / Odoo | Per-customer instance of a plan. Created when Odoo confirms an order or subscription; coupled via Odoo origin reference and carries customer/channel/outlet as references (see [8.1 Odoo Integration](../8-integration-devops/1-odoo-integration.md)). |
| Entitlement | ABS / Odoo | ABS record granting a customer the right to use services (e.g. swaps). Created from Odoo orders and subscriptions; Odoo remains financial SoR. |
| Entitlement Handshake | Odoo ↔ ABS Integration | Integration pattern where Odoo order/subscription confirmation and deposit receipt trigger ABS entitlements and asset allocation while Odoo remains system of record for money (see Pattern 2 in [8.1 Odoo Integration](../8-integration-devops/1-odoo-integration.md)). |
| Asset-Assignment Service | ABS / Odoo | ABS service that binds a specific vehicle ITEM to a contract (e.g. 12-month pairing). Linked to Contract PUs in Odoo for long-term swap privileges. |
| Vehicle-Pairing Service | ABS / Service PU | Access-type ABS service that pairs a specific vehicle to swap eligibility for a defined duration; must be duration-aligned with bundled swap access services (see [3.3 BSS Bundles](../3-product-bundle-library/3-bss-bundles.md)). |
| Fleet | ABS / Operations | Managed collection of vehicles under ABS control (e.g. MotBat fleet). Distinct from the swap network; vehicles belong to the fleet, not the network. |
| Network (Swap Network) | ABS / Service PU | Collection of physical swap locations (stations) that provide swap service; modeled as a service in ABS and as outlets/sites in Odoo. |
| Battery Circulation | ABS / Service PU | Service and operational concept for the dynamic pool of batteries circulating across the swap network and fleet, distinct from static inventory. |
| Odoo–ABS Object Mapping | Integration Model | Agreed mapping between Odoo models (e.g. `product.template`, `sale.order`, `res.partner`) and ABS objects (services, bundles, plans, entitlements, sites) documented in the Odoo ↔ ABS correspondence table (see [8.1 Odoo Integration](../8-integration-devops/1-odoo-integration.md)). |
| Sales Order (`sale.order`) | Odoo | Core commercial transaction document backing retail and subscription flows. Line items are PUs; order confirmation triggers ABS entitlement creation. |
| Sales Session | OVApp / ABS / Odoo | Frontend retail session that wraps a draft `sale.order` in Odoo and, upon confirmation, results in ABS `plan_instance` and entitlement creation. |
| Channel Partner | Odoo / ABS | Organisation selling on behalf of OVES, modeled as `res.partner` in Odoo and referenced as channel in ABS plans/entitlements (see [5.3 Sales Channel](../5-transactional-models/3-sales-channel.md)). |
| Outlet | Odoo / ABS | Retail location where sales and swaps occur. Modeled as `ov.outlet` + `res.partner` site in Odoo; mirrored as site/station in ABS (see [5.3 Sales Channel](../5-transactional-models/3-sales-channel.md)). |
