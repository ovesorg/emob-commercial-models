## BSS Bundles

This section will contain bundle collections specific to **Battery Swap Service (BSS)**.

### Intent

- Capture real bundle definitions used for BSS (e.g., Starter Packs, Driver Packs).
- Each bundle should be defined using the pattern in `2-service-templates.md`.
- Focus initially on:
  - New customer onboarding bundles
  - High-usage / fleet bundles
  - Upgrade or add-on bundles linked to existing PUs.

*(Bundle definitions to be added as they are agreed by the product team.)*
